Welcome to the 3rd Entelect Game Jam! We hope you'll have a lot of fun making a fun little game today.

# Theme & Rules

The theme is simple: make a fun racing game using the provided art and this example project as starting point(both optional, but recommended due to the short timeframe).

In terms of rules:
 * You have 8 hours (+1 for submission). Start at 08:00 finish at 17:00.
 * During submission hour submit Windows binaries to: https://itch.io/jam/entelect-jam-3
 * __May__ use any free / open-source art or sound resources.
 * Individual submissions (no teams).
 
After submission we'll play each other's games and vote on 3 categories:
 * Fun: Is the game fun?
 * Graphics: Is the game pretty and juicy?
 * Coolness: Does the game perhaps fall flat in other areas but tried to do something cool?
